# What is the problem

## Brief:
Develop accessible, affordable technology or enhance existing technology to mitigate African elephant based Human
Wildlife Conflict for vulnerable people living in and around Mozambique’s Limpopo National Park.

## Challenge and problem statement
[Human Wildlife Conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93wildlife_conflict) (HWC): When the interaction between humans and wildlife result in negative impacts including
crop destruction or death. THis is a reality for poor, vulnerable people living in and around Mozambique’s rural [Limpopo
National Park](https://www.peaceparks.org/parks/limpopo-national-park/) (LNP) where HWC occurs regularly. This challenge is focused on developing new (or expanding on
existing) technology that is affordable, accessible and will aid community members with the early detection or deterring
of HWC incidents with African elephants.

## Background
The people living in and around LNP in Mozambique are poor, vulnerable and at risk. They experience the effects of climate change first-hand and compete with local wildlife for natural resources. It’s a harsh landscape with regular droughts and few opportunities. These people survive through subsistence farming and when their crops are destroyed by animals, a year’s worth of food is lost, leaving them in a dire situation. There are no shops to buy produce and even if there were, they would rarely have the means to buy additional food. These farmers also have cattle that competes for scarce water resources and rangelands with local wildlife.

African elephants are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Back in the 1930s it is estimated that there were over 10 million elephants roaming across the African continent. Today, due to poaching, conflict and human encroachment, their numbers have effectively been decimated, leaving approximately 415,000 elephants left in the wild. It is said that no fence can keep out a roaming bull elephant. These bulls as well as large family herds often move through the villages in and around LNP, destroying infrastructure, crops and in extreme circumstances, killing community members. Unfortunately, in retaliation, these incidents often result in villagers taking matters into their own hands and killing these elephants .

## Current approach
In an effort to mitigate this, 16 elephants in the area from different herds have been collared. Their movements are tracked with satellite technology and visual spotting. The Park has six rangers tasked with assisting communities with HWC incidents, to warn them when elephant herds move in close proximity of their villages and to capture incident reports.

However, the landscape is vast, over 1 000 000 Ha and with limited capacity, it is not always possible to reach the communities in time to warn them.
There is very limited cellphone coverage in these areas.

# The team
## Who are Stuck in ViM?

Stuck in ViM, a team of students from both Chalmers and Gothenburg University. With a good mix of competent, visionary and driven people, we hope to impress the judges. Comptences range from chemical and software engineering, to cognitive science and physics. The team also consists of people from around the world, something we hope helps us be inclusive in our solutions.

## What we need in the submission on Shawee :
```
- Read me file: problem, description of the solution, the idea which stands behind the code, contact info for the team
- File with the developed solution’s code 
- Open source license
- Presentation
- 3 minute video with no audio, which will be used to present on Sunday.

On Sunday, we will take the videos and the team will pitch live via voice! 

In general, each team should describe all the files in their own folder. In README they should also add some hashtags connected to the topic (health/environment/economic).
